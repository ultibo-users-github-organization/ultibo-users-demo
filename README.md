# Participation

If you are working in your own repo and want your repo included as a function in the multifunctional demo:

* Keep working in your repo and expect to merge pull requests needed to maintain your repo’s suitability for inclusion
* Make an informal request anywhere in the [ultibo forum](https://ultibo.org/forum/index.php)

If you are not working in your own repo, please discuss in the forum.
